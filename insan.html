            Lionel Messi, born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina,
            is widely regarded as one of the greatest football (soccer) players of all time.<br>
            Here is an overview of Messi's life story:<br>
            <br>
            <b>Early Life:</b> <br>
            Messi was born into a working-class family, and his love for football became apparent at a very young age.<br>
            His grandmother played a significant role in supporting his early passion for the sport. At the age of six,
            Messi joined the local club, Newell's Old Boys, where he showcased extraordinary skills even as a child.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Health Challenges:</b><br>
            At the age of 11, Messi faced a major hurdle in his life when he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency.<br>
            His family could not afford the treatment, but Messi's talent caught the attention of FC Barcelona, 
            which offered to pay for his medical bills and bring him to Spain.<br>
            Messi and his family moved to Barcelona, where he joined the youth academy La Masia.<br>
            <br>
            <b>FC Barcelona Career:</b><br>
            Messi's professional career took off with FC Barcelona, where he made his first-team debut at the age of 16 in 2003.<br>
            He quickly became an integral part of the team, 
            forming a formidable partnership with players like Xavi and Andr√©s Iniesta.<br>
            Messi's incredible dribbling, precise finishing, and vision on the field set him apart.<br>
            He played a crucial role in Barcelona's success, helping the team win numerous domestic and international titles,
            including several UEFA Champions League and La Liga trophies.<br>
            Messi's performances earned him multiple FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, solidifying his status as the world's best player.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Records and Achievements:</b><br>
            Throughout his career, Messi broke numerous records, 
            including becoming Barcelona's all-time leading goal-scorer and setting records for the most goals in a calendar year.<br>
            His individual honors include six Ballon d'Or awards, showcasing his consistent excellence.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Paris Saint-Germain (PSG):</b><br>
            In August 2021, Messi's long association with FC Barcelona came to an end due to financial difficulties faced by the club.<br>
            Messi signed with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), marking a new chapter in his illustrious career.<br>
            <br>
            <b>International Career:</b><br>
            Messi has also represented the Argentine national team since his youth.<br>
            Despite his success at the club level, winning a major international trophy with Argentina eluded him for many years.<br>
            However, in July 2021, Messi and Argentina won the Copa America, defeating Brazil in the final.<br>
            It was a significant moment in Messi's career as he finally secured a major international title.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Messi's life story is a remarkable journey of talent, determination, and resilience,
            showcasing his rise from a young boy with health challenges to a football legend celebrated worldwide.</strong>
